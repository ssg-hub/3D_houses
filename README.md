# 3D_houses :houses: Project

**Project duration :** 2 weeks

**Project dates :** 14th - 21st June, 2021

### Team Spacy : _Arnaud D, Lyes R, Shilpa S_

### Project Objective :
The project **3D_houses** ojective is to generate a **3D** model of the building structure for a given address in the Flanders region of **Belgium**.  

***Input :*** _An address given by user or selected by user from a pre-determined list._  
Example : Rue de Geneve 12, Evere
Google map view :

***Output :*** _A **3D** image rendered for the building structure at the above address._  
Example :

### Mission objectives :
Consolidate the knowledge in Python :snake:, specifically in :

:heavy_check_mark: NumPy  
:heavy_check_mark: Pandas  
:heavy_check_mark: Matplotlib  

### Learning Objectives

:heavy_check_mark: **to be able to search and implement new libraries**  
_New libraries searched and explored_  
* geopandas
* osgeo , gdal
* rastario
* shapely

:heavy_check_mark: **to be able to read and use the shapefile format**  
Read and used shapefiles from .shp files within [public data](https://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/myminfin-web/pages/cadastral-plans) for Belgium coordinate system _L_72 i.e.Lambert 72_  

:heavy_check_mark: **to be able to read and use geoTIFFs**  
Read and used geoTIFFs from .tif files within the **DTM** and **DSM** public data.  

:heavy_check_mark: **to be able to render a _3D_ plot**  
(link to 3D plot)

:heavy_check_mark: **to be able to present a final product**     
(link to the jupyter notebook)

### The Client and mission behind the project  
Client: LIDAR PLANES, active in the Geospatial industry. 
End use of data : To launch a new branch in the insurance business.
3D_houses project goal : To build a solution with the client data to model a house in 3D with only a home address.

**Must-have features** 3D lookup of houses :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark: Delivered  

**Nice-to-have features**  
Optimize your solution to have the result as fast as possible.  
Features like the living area of the house in mÂ², how many floors, if there is a pool, the vegetation in the neighborhood, etc...  
Better visualization.  :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark: Delivered
